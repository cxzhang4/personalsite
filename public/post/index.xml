      <description>How much should Player X make?
As I was searching for existing analyses, I came across Lewis Pipkin’s use of machine learning. I will address some mistakes I think he made in his analysis.
“As per standard ML procedure”, he performed a test-train split on the data, then applied the model to his entire dataset (train AND test) to come up with “diagnoses”.The problem is… this ISN’T a standard supervised learning procedure.</description>
