      <description>I use k-nearest neighbors regression to estimate fair salaries for NBA players based on the market for players of a similar caliber. I re-predict on the training set (gasp!), but use leave-one-out predictions to prevent severe overfitting. I argue that it is counterproductive to perform a test-train split when re-predicting on the training set because this will make predictions on the test set less accurate. I argue that using sophisticated ensemble learning methods is overkill, and less interpretable and useful than a simpler method such as k-nearest neighbors.</description>
