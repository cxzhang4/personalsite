      <description>How much should Player X make?
As I was searching for existing analyses, I came across Lewis Pipkin’s use of machine learning. I will address some mistakes I think he made in his analysis.
“As per standard ML procedure”, he performed a test-train split on the data, then applied the model to his entire dataset (train AND test) to come up with “diagnoses”.The problem is… this ISN’T a standard supervised learning procedure.</description>

      <description>I graduated with a BS in Statistics and Computer Science from the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign. I like applying knowledge of those fields to organize, understand, and communicate information in engaging ways.
This will be a project portfolio, and a blog with data analyses, explanations of technical concepts, and opinions on life. Everything here is a living document - please let me know if you think I&amp;rsquo;m wrong.
I&amp;rsquo;m on the job market!</description>
