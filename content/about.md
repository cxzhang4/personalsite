I graduated with a BS in Statistics and Computer Science from the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign. I like applying knowledge of those fields to organize, understand, and communicate information in engaging ways.

This will be a project portfolio, and a blog with data analyses, explanations of technical concepts, and opinions on life. Everything here is a living document - please let me know if you think I'm wrong.

I'm on the job market! Get in touch if you want to work with me (or just chat).
